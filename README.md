# Pre-Work-study-guide

## Description

This site is to provide a beginner project to practice the basics of creating a website.
My motivation for this project was to begin learning developing working concepts along side knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and the use of Git and GitHub.
The problem this solves is it will provide me a place to input notes to use as a reference guide going forward in the course.
I learnt all the basics needed of the above mentioned languages but also gained an insight on what working on a web application project would be like.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this site simply browse to the URL and read the notes, it will be seperated into sections for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git for ease of reading. 
To see the example of JaveScript please open the DevTools console by right-clicking on the screen and selecting "Inspect" then select Console from the above options.
